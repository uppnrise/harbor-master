# HarborMaster Constitution

## Project Vision

**Mission Statement:**
Build a powerful, cross-platform desktop container management application that provides enterprise-grade functionality with a delightful user experience. HarborMaster empowers developers and DevOps engineers to manage Docker, Podman, and Kubernetes workloads efficiently across Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Core Principles

### 1. Code Quality & Architecture

**Principle:** Write maintainable, testable, and well-documented code that follows industry best practices.

**Guidelines:**
- Follow SOLID principles and design patterns
- Use dependency injection for testability
- Maintain clear separation of concerns (UI, Business Logic, Data)
- Keep functions small and focused (< 50 lines)
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Comment complex logic and document public APIs
- Avoid premature optimization - clarity first, performance second

**Validation:**
- Code reviews required for all changes
- Static analysis tools must pass (ESLint, TypeScript strict mode)
- Complexity metrics monitored (cyclomatic complexity < 10)

---

### 2. Testing Standards

**Principle:** Comprehensive testing ensures reliability and enables confident refactoring.

**Guidelines:**
- Minimum 80% code coverage for core modules (runtime detection, container operations)
- Write tests before fixing bugs (reproduce first)
- Use the testing pyramid: more unit tests, fewer integration tests, critical E2E tests
- Mock external dependencies (Docker/Podman APIs) in unit tests
- Integration tests must be idempotent and clean up after themselves
- E2E tests cover critical user workflows
- Performance tests validate benchmarks

**Test Types:**
- **Unit Tests:** Business logic, utilities, state management
- **Integration Tests:** Runtime detection, API interactions
- **E2E Tests:** Complete user workflows (create container, view logs, etc.)
- **Performance Tests:** Startup time, list rendering, memory usage

**Validation:**
- CI must run all tests before merge
- Coverage thresholds enforced in CI
- Test execution time monitored (unit tests < 30s, full suite < 5 minutes)

---

### 3. User Experience Consistency

**Principle:** Provide a native, intuitive experience that feels consistent across all platforms while respecting platform conventions.

**Guidelines:**
- **Native Feel:** Use platform-specific conventions (menu bars, keyboard shortcuts, etc.)
- **Consistency:** Maintain consistent UI patterns within the app
- **Progressive Disclosure:** Show simple interfaces by default, advanced options on demand
- **Fast Feedback:** Operations provide immediate visual feedback
- **Error Recovery:** Clear error messages with actionable next steps
- **Accessibility:** WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliance minimum
- **Keyboard Navigation:** All features accessible via keyboard
- **Dark Mode:** Support both light and dark themes

**Design System:**
- Use consistent spacing (4px/8px/16px/24px grid)
- Maintain color palette across all components
- Typography scale for hierarchy
- Consistent iconography (20px/24px standard sizes)
- Animation timing (200ms for micro-interactions, 300ms for transitions)

**Validation:**
- Usability testing with target users
- Accessibility audits (axe, Lighthouse)
- Cross-platform testing on real hardware
- Performance profiling (60 FPS target)

---

### 4. Performance Requirements

**Principle:** The application must be fast, responsive, and efficient with system resources.

**Benchmarks:**
- **Startup Time:** < 2 seconds from launch to usable
- **Container List:** < 500ms to fetch and render 100 containers
- **Search/Filter:** < 100ms for client-side operations
- **Runtime Detection:** < 500ms initial detection, < 10ms cached
- **Memory Usage (Idle):** < 150MB
- **Memory Usage (Active):** < 300MB with 100 containers loaded
- **UI Responsiveness:** 60 FPS minimum, no frame drops during interactions
- **Log Streaming:** Handle 1000 lines/second without UI lag

**Optimization Strategies:**
- Virtual scrolling for large lists
- Progressive loading of data
- Debouncing/throttling for expensive operations
- Code splitting and lazy loading
- Efficient state updates (avoid unnecessary re-renders)
- Worker threads for CPU-intensive tasks
- Caching with smart invalidation

**Validation:**
- Performance tests in CI
- Memory leak detection
- Profiling before releases
- Regression detection (< 10% degradation)

---

### 5. Security & Privacy

**Principle:** Protect user data and system security at all times.

**Guidelines:**
- **Credentials:** Store securely using OS keychain/credential manager
- **Input Validation:** Sanitize all user input
- **Dependencies:** Regular security audits (Snyk, Dependabot)
- **Updates:** Secure auto-update mechanism with signature verification
- **Telemetry:** Opt-in only, transparent about data collection
- **Permissions:** Request minimal required permissions
- **Logs:** Never log sensitive information (passwords, tokens)
- **CSP:** Implement Content Security Policy for web content

**Validation:**
- Security audits before major releases
- Dependency scanning in CI
- Penetration testing for v1.0
- No high/critical vulnerabilities in dependencies

---

### 6. Cross-Platform Compatibility

**Principle:** Provide first-class experience on Windows, macOS, and Linux with platform-specific optimizations.

**Guidelines:**
- Test on all three platforms throughout development
- Support platform-specific features (WSL2, Hyper-V, Virtualization.framework, systemd)
- Use native APIs where appropriate
- Handle platform differences gracefully
- Document platform-specific requirements

**Platform Support:**
- **Windows:** 10/11 (Pro/Enterprise/Home), Windows Server 2019+
- **macOS:** 11+ (Big Sur and newer), Intel and Apple Silicon
- **Linux:** Ubuntu 20.04+, Debian 11+, Fedora 35+, Arch

**Validation:**
- CI runs on all platforms
- Manual testing on major versions
- Platform-specific feature testing

---

### 7. Runtime Compatibility

**Principle:** Support both Docker and Podman equally well, with intelligent runtime detection and switching.

**Guidelines:**
- **Docker:** Support version 20.10+
- **Podman:** Support version 3.0+
- **Detection:** Automatic discovery of installed runtimes
- **Switching:** Seamless runtime switching without app restart
- **Graceful Degradation:** Work with limited functionality if runtime unavailable
- **API Compatibility:** Handle API version differences

**Validation:**
- Test with multiple Docker versions
- Test with multiple Podman versions
- Test rootless and rootful Podman
- Test Docker Desktop and standalone Docker

---

### 8. Documentation Standards

**Principle:** Comprehensive documentation enables users and contributors.

**Guidelines:**
- **User Documentation:** Clear guides for all features
- **Developer Documentation:** Architecture, setup, contributing
- **Code Documentation:** JSDoc/TSDoc for public APIs
- **API Documentation:** OpenAPI spec if exposing API
- **Changelog:** Document all changes following Keep a Changelog
- **README:** Clear project description and quick start

**Content Requirements:**
- Getting started guide (< 5 minutes to first container)
- Feature documentation with screenshots
- Troubleshooting guides for common issues
- Keyboard shortcuts reference
- FAQ section

---

### 9. Development Workflow

**Principle:** Streamlined development process that enables rapid iteration with quality.

**Guidelines:**
- **Version Control:** Git with meaningful commit messages (Conventional Commits)
- **Branching:** Feature branches from main, merge via PR
- **Code Review:** All changes require review
- **CI/CD:** Automated testing, building, and deployment
- **Release Process:** Semantic versioning, automated releases
- **Issue Tracking:** GitHub Issues with labels and milestones

**Commit Message Format:**
```
type(scope): description

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `chore`

---

### 10. Technical Stack

**Principle:** Use proven, maintainable technologies that align with project goals.

**Decisions:**
- **Framework:** Tauri (Rust + Web) for performance and smaller bundle size
  - Alternative: Electron if team prefers JavaScript throughout
- **UI Framework:** React with TypeScript
- **State Management:** Zustand or Redux Toolkit
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS with CSS-in-JS for dynamic styles
- **Testing:** Vitest (unit), Playwright (E2E)
- **Backend Logic:** Rust (Tauri commands) or Node.js (Electron)
- **Build Tool:** Vite
- **Package Manager:** pnpm

**Rationale:**
- Tauri: 10x smaller bundle, better performance, Rust security
- React: Mature ecosystem, excellent tooling
- TypeScript: Type safety prevents bugs
- Tailwind: Rapid UI development, consistent styling
